# 🎯 Ball Detection using YOLOv11 and OpenCV
A deep learning-based project for detecting and tracking a ball in real-time using YOLOv11 and OpenCV.

# 📌 Description
This project uses YOLOv11 (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art object detection model, combined with OpenCV for real-time ball detection and tracking.

✅ Detects and tracks a ball in images, videos, or live webcam feeds
✅ Uses YOLOv11 for efficient and fast detection
✅ Supports multiple ball types (e.g., soccer, basketball, tennis)
✅ Can be optimized for real-time applications

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x
YOLOv11 (for object detection)
OpenCV (for image processing and visualization)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Torch (for deep learning model inference)
